Need to make some cs code similar to PowerWorker_LimbRegen.cs
maybe add to DeathRest code?

Checkout sanguophage abilities and add this limb regen as an ability
It will add the Hediff Regrow limb

checkout morepsycasts_partiallygrown hediff and create a similar one

use morepsycasdefs.xml icons/regrow_bodypart for icon

add new Gene i.e GeneDef with prerequisites
make sure sanguophages have this geneDef
OR patch existing Gene to give ability RegrowLimb


CHECKOUT PowerWorker_LimbRegen for how to get all small parts regening as well so don't have to use power multiple times
Increase hemogen cost
Require 1 week cooldown

Extend functionality of HediffDef Deathrest to regrow limbs

Patch Deathrest to have comp which regrows new body parts
comp that regrows new body parts will add hediff regrowing limb
regrowing limb will be responsible for regrowing, should be much faster during deathrest
